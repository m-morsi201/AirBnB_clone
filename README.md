Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
The "0x00. AirBnB clone - The console" project
is the first step towards building your first full web application
The AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because
I will use what I am  building during this project
with all other following projects
HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

What’s a command interpreter?
we want to be able to manage the objects of our project

1. Create a new object.
2. Retrieve an object from a file, a database.
3. Do operations on objects.
4. Update attributes of an object.
5. Destroy an object.
